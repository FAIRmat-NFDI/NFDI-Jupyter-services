# Jupyter Services Overview

Jupyter Notebooks are an interactive computing environment for creating and sharing documents with live code, text, and visualizations. They consist of cells for code and text, can be used for data science and other tasks, and support multiple programming languages. Notebooks can be saved and shared, making collaboration and showcasing work easy.

This site wants to provide an overview of avaiable Jupyter Services for researchers in Germany. You can filter the Services with the facets on the right. If **your** instance is missing, have a look at our [contribution page](template.md). If you are interessted in current statistics, have a look [here](stats.md).
